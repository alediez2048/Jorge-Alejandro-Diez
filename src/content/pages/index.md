**Hello stranger, my name is Jorge Alejandro Diez and I'm a Technical Project Manager. I help build digital products that tell engaging stories and help businesses increase traffic and conversions online.**

**Early in my career as a web developer, I had the opportunity to work alongside incredible senior designers, content specialists, and project managers who raised my standards for what’s expected of any web application.**\
\
**I’ve also learned that successful digital products start with a thorough understanding of the end-user and its pain points. By leveraging data from users and their experiences we can drive better decision-making across design, content, and performance.**

**On this site you can see my background and previous work, current projects, and future goals, hopefully, we share some in common. Make yourself at home!**
